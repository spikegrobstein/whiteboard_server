# WhiteboardServer

A website providing a real-time whiteboard drawing between clients. Optimized
for tablets and touch devices, but still very much a work in progress.

I worked on this for a few months in my spare time but lost interest. It was built
on Elixir 0.12.x, uses PostgreSQL as a datastore and communicates with clients over
websockets.

See `Rakefile` and `migrations` directory for database stuffs.

If anyone wants to take this thing over, that would be dope.

A slightly out-dated version of this code is still live @ whiteboard.spike.cx. Sign up
for an account and create a whiteboard... then share the link with a friend who is also
logged in (it's super alpha!)
